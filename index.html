It's a very mean and nasty place, and I don't care how tough you are... it will beat you to your knees and keep you there if you let it. You, me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit... and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! If you know what you're worth, go and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers... saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody! Cowards do that, and that ain't you! You're better than that!</p></div>
